## Hi there, I'm Ayfri.
#### What do I do ?
I'm a little young french developer, knowing JavaScript, TypeScript and Java (and briefly other languages).
I do mainly discord bots, games but also utils softwares and some utils libraries.

I have a lot of projects not finished (like everybody) but I have a lot of active projects that I've not published here yet, be patient :)
